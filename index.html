To his surprise, these games seem to light up the arcade, and could maybe even light up his path of escape. In Prism, play as  Dylan in his quest to get home and return to Mom before the night comes to an end.</p>

        <a id="biography"><i>A little personal history...</i></a><br>
        <p class="clean">I began coding in the tenth grade using the Visual Basic language. I had never had a direct interest in coding before this point, but did wonder how games did what they did from time to time. Then, my focus shifted to Python in the 11th Grade and I quickly became proficient in the language. Now being a first-year University student, I have self-taught myself JavaScript, am learning Java in school, and also teaching myself what's necessary for HTML and CSS to create this site. <br><br>I am of Italian descent, enjoy playing video-games, watching movies, spending time with friends and family, learning, growing, and pushing the capabilities of what code can do.</p>

        <a id="future"><i>Where do I want to Go?</i></a><br>
        <p class="clean">I'm not entirely sure, to be honest. I'm currently focused on getting my degree while bettering myself in any way I can-- intellectually, physically, emotionally. <br><br>
            I think it would be really cool to work at a company like Google or Microsoft, or something like that-- but it seems unlikely. All I can definitively say for now is that I want my ability to code to have led me to a better place in my life (not that my current place in life is bad, because it isn't.) I just think it would be really cool for my skills and passions to be the things that push me forward in life.<br><br>
            I want to keep expanding my skillset, coding-wise. I plan to learn C++ over the summer, and then begin to focus on more front-end stuff. I know that's a ridiculous thing to say considering I literally have a website, but this thing was made by pure luck and a lot of googling. I want to become a better coder.<br><br>
            I've always been worried about my ability to progress in this field, even though I know I'm not incompetent when it comes to this stuff. I want that irrational fear to be gone. That would be pretty cool.<br><br>
