# History Lesson Time!
I first began coding in the 10th Grade, with Visual Basic as my first language. Before this point, I had known that I wanted to get into the Computer Science / Software Development field-- but I didn't know what that meant. In my 10th Grade "Intro to Computer Sciences" class, I discovered that I truly excelled at coding. I was able to solve problems with ease and efficiency. This made me want to take the following year's course as well-- Computer Science. What an upgrade. This is where I first learned about PYTHON, and began to learn how to code it. This is where I really hit my stride. I loved it so much, I went ahead of the entire class, and was far, far ahead for the entirety of the course. This year, I continued my education, Python-wise, learning about Object-Orientated Programming. After creating the project I'm most proud of, Prism, with my friends, I decided to start to learn Java. I have currently made my way through most of Java's basics, and am hoping to learn other languages such as Javascript, C++, and more as time goes on.
