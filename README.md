# History Lesson Time!
I first began coding in the 10th Grade, with Visual Basic as my first language. Before this point, I had known that I wanted to get into the Computer Science / Software Development field-- but I didn't know what that meant. In my 10th Grade "Intro to Computer Sciences" class, I discovered that I truly excelled at coding. I was able to solve problems with ease and efficiency. This made me want to take the following year's course as well-- Computer Science. What an upgrade. This is where I first learned about PYTHON, and began to learn how to code it. This is where I really hit my stride. I loved it so much, I went ahead of the entire class, and was far, far ahead for the entirety of the course. This year, I continued my education, Python-wise, learning about Object-Orientated Programming. After creating the project I'm most proud of, Prism, with my friends, I decided to start to learn Java. I have currently made my way through most of Java's basics, and am hoping to learn other languages such as Javascript, C++, and more as time goes on.

## My All-Time Favourites!

_Now, this is where the money is._

I have amassed quite a lot of projects over the last 3 years, although the first years' projects are lost. Here's some of my all-time favourite ones.

# Prism
The crowned-jewel of my coding career thus far. Prism is the amalgamation of everything I've learned, and was a true passion project for my friends and I to create.

Prism features unqiue features like weather, save-games, a 2.5D Perspective view, an easy-to-use GUI, and more.

Lost in an arcade at night, 7 Year Old Dylan Park finds refuge in playing the few arcade machines left running overnight. To his surprise, these games seem to light up the arcade, and could maybe even light up his path of escape. In Prism, play as Dylan in his quest to get home and return to Mom before the night comes to an end.

Prism is downloadable off of my [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastiandeluca/Prism).
