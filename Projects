## My All-Time Favourites!

_Now, this is where the money is._

I have amassed quite a lot of projects over the last 3 years, although the first years' projects are lost. Here's some of my all-time favourite ones.

# Prism
The crowned-jewel of my coding career thus far. Prism is the amalgamation of everything I've learned thus far, and was a true passion project for my friends and I to create.

Prism features unqiue features like weather, save-games, a 2.5D Perspective view, an easy-to-use GUI, and more.

Lost in an arcade at night, 7 Year Old Dylan Park finds refuge in playing the few arcade machines left running overnight. To his surprise, these games seem to light up the arcade, and could maybe even light up his path of escape. In Prism, play as Dylan in his quest to get home and return to Mom before the night comes to an end.

Prism is downloadable off of my GitHub, or off of the 'Foo Games' website.
