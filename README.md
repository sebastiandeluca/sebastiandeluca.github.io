 ### NOTE: THIS SITE IS A WORK-IN-PROGRESS!

# A little more about me:
I began coding in Grade 10 with Visual Basic, and have since expanded my skills to become proficient in Python and become familiar with Java and C++ in my 3+ years of experience. I excel in creating small-medium programs, or games. I love to learn, grow, and code, and I love seeing code in action!

# My All-Time Favourites!

_Some of my projects._

I have amassed quite a lot of projects over the last 3 years, although the first years' projects are lost. Here's some of my all-time favourite ones.

## Prism
The crowned-jewel of my coding career thus far. Prism is the amalgamation of everything I've learned, and was a true passion project for my friends and I to create.

Prism features unqiue features like weather, save-games, a 2.5D Perspective view, an easy-to-use GUI, and more.

_SYNOPSIS_

Lost in an arcade at night, 7 Year Old Dylan Park finds refuge in playing the few arcade machines left running overnight. To his surprise, these games seem to light up the arcade, and could maybe even light up his path of escape. In Prism, play as Dylan in his quest to get home and return to Mom before the night comes to an end.

Prism is downloadable off of my [GitHub](https://github.com/sebastiandeluca/Prism), or off of the [Foo Games Website](https://www.sites.google.com/view/foogames)

_My Contribution:_

For Prism, I handled the creation of the art of the game. I also, generally, conjured up most of the ideas for features and helmed the story development. I also volunteered to lead the development of the 'Main Hub' (known as the arcade), as well as 2 of the 4 inner-games.

## ASCII-Based UNO
A Grade 11 Culminating Assessment

_My Contribution:_

For ASCII-UNO, I solely developed the player-side of things, such as UI, gameplay, and the menus.

## Python Day Planner
A Python-based Day Planner for Grade 12's Culminating Assessment

_Features:_

Python Day Planner utilizes many of Python's capabilities, such as:
 - File I/O
 - Recursion
 - Exception Handling
 
 
 ## Escape From The Dungeon
 A recursion-based Dungeon Crawler I created because I was bored, so I went above and beyond on an assignment.
 
 _Features:_
 
 - Recursion
 - Character Creation
